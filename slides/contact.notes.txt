'ecto' was taken on github.  We'd been up too late coding, plasmodic was it.

Why ecto?  Originally from the greek 'outside' or 'external'.  Turns
out that 'ecto' was a 1987 album from singer/songwriter Happy Rhodes,
who has a wide enough vocal range that one of her songs was once
mislabeled and put up on napster as a duet between annie lennox and
kate bush.  ecto.org is a fan website run by people who call
themselves 'ectophiles'.
