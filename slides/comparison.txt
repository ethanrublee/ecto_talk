ROS: supports any language you can write serialization method generators for
     and implement the ROS transport protocol (xmlrpc)

ecto:  c++.  python for wrappers only.



transports centrally defined          
no inherent notion of transport

requires a master   
no master

master has no global knowledge of what is happening, doesn't control execution
ecto:  scheduler knows what is happening, absolutely controls execution


ROS:   tons of drivers for hardware
ecto:  kinect, cameras.



17:29 < fergs> the big thing is this: ros has PR2 drivers, etc, these
               solve a problem Ecto doesn't care about... however if
               you want to build a perception system (or any sort of
               graph-based processing), you either have to A) build
               the entire thing inside a single node (which probably
               limits code reuse, and maintainability) or B) build a
               whole bunch of ecto::cell-sized pieces and connect them
               with lots of topics (as nodes performance degrades
               horribly, as nodelets you build a whole bunch of
               ecto::cell-sized pieces and connect them with lots of
               topics (as nodes performance degrades horribly, as
               nodelets you have a headache putting them together in
               an XML launch file) and I'm sure over time we'll find
               things to move into besides perception (for instance,
               arm navigation planning could probably benefit from
               ecto) grasping analysis as well
